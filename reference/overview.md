# Overview

Every iNProve instance supports a multi-tenant architecture.

A tenant is known as an institution. All resources reside under an institution.

::: info

The term institution refers to the highest level of an educational organization (example: Ngee Ann Polytechnic, National University of Singapore, etc). This is different from an academic school (example: School of ICT).

:::

All other resources reside under the institution.

## Groups

Groups are used to share information between a collection of users. Most features of iNProve are accessed through a group.

For example, a group can be created for a module, or a Special Interest Group.

### Roles

Every member of a group is associated with a role.

| Role     | Permissions | Remarks                      |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner    | All         | There can be multiple owners |
| Educator | Restricted  | Usually lecturers            |
| Member   | Restricted  | Usually students             |

### Announcements

Announcements are used to distribute information to everyone in a group. Posting announcements are limited.

### Deadlines

Deadlines are tasks submitted by group members with a due date. Other members can upvote a deadline to signify importance or authenticity.

### Events

Events signify important dates / times. For example, an examination. Deadlines are shared with everyone in the group.

### Forums

Forums facilitate discussions between users. A forum must have a name, such as "General". A group can have multiple forums.

::: info

In a group which contains students of an entire module, forums can be used to split between classes.

Access control will be introduced in the future.
